# When did you say that?

FuzzyWuzzy is a powerful library and can serve various use cases.
Out of the box, it works with lists only.
But with some tweaks you can harnesss the power of fuzzyWuzzy with dictionaries.

Here's is a sample use case:
Identifying the time for matching sentences out of a video/audio transcript. 

Obtaining the timestamp of an a/v can be accomplished with some libraries and websites but locating the exact or even closely matching sentences can be a daunting task.

There aren't many libraries or readymade logic for that.

So, here I present you the power to do so in least lines with the dirtiest of the text.

Feel free to use this sample code :)
